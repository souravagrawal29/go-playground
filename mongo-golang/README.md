# mongo-golang

Refer to [Golang and Mongo Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zICaTPBkupY) for the full walkthrough of building the CRUD app.

Instead of using the deprecated mgo.v2 mongo driver for Go, the project uses the latest v2 mongo driver to connect to the database and perform operations.

All required information on how to use the driver can be found here [mongo-golang-driver](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/get-started)
